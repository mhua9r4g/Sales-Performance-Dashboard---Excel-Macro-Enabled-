# ðŸ§® Sales Performance Dashboard â€“ Excel (Beginner Project)

## ðŸ“„ Executive Summary

This is my **first Excel data visualization project**, designed to analyze and present **state-wise sales performance across India** in a clear and interactive format. Built using core Excel tools such as **PivotTables, slicers, conditional formatting**, and **basic VBA macros**, the dashboard provides insight into how different regions, products, and sales executives perform.

Itâ€™s an early step in my journey toward mastering data analytics â€” combining curiosity, design, and logic.
